I have Developed the frontend in two ways:

  First One: Using PHP
  Under this I have implemented almost all the task that we are suppose to do both frontend and backend, like
  1. Uploading images in database, fetching and storing the data. 
  2. Intuitive UI/UX i.e User will able to see the progress of eacg file upload
  3. Filtering based on PNG, SVG and JPG
  4. Thumbnail View and List View in Front Page
  5. User is able to edit the uploaded image i.e they can delete it from the database
  6. Responsive layout
  7. Used PHP API Using Ajax the methods get called on each html page
  8. Multiple Image Upload
 
 Browse Files Under PHP Folder
 
  Second One: In ReactJs
  Under this I have implemented the frontend part only because of time constraint, however I have decided to call the API to store and    fetch data from the database.
  1. Admin
    a. Upload section
    b. Edit Section
  2. Home
    a. List View Display
    b. Thumbnail View Display
    c. Toggling between list and Thumnail View
    d. Hosted the task on surge
